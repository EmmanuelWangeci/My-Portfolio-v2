# My-Portfolio-v2

Hello everyone!

I'm Emmanuel Wangeci, and this project marks an important step in my learning journey. While I did not create this entirely from scratch, I built upon an inspiring design by my friend **EkiZR**. By adapting and experimenting with their design, I was able to deepen my understanding of key web technologies such as ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, AOS, Firebase, Framer Motion, Lucide, Material UI, and SweetAlert2.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This project was developed as a learning tool. I used EkiZR's design as a foundation to explore and understand various functionalities like animation, real-time database integration with Firebase, and overall website interactivity. It is important to note that this work is not an original creation from scratch, but rather a stepping stone that has greatly informed the development of my advanced Portfolio v3, which will feature my own ideas, design improvements, and enhanced functionality.

**Tech Stack Used:**

- **ReactJS**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **AOS**
- **Firebase**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Lucide**
- **Material UI**
- **SweetAlert2**

**Credits:**  
A huge thank you to **EkiZR** for their invaluable guidance and support. Their design and insights have been instrumental in helping me learn and evolve my approach to building engaging and dynamic web experiences. ðŸ™Œ

**Looking Ahead:**  
The lessons learned from this project have paved the way for my upcoming Portfolio v3â€”a fully advanced version featuring my own unique ideas, design improvements, and innovative functionalities. Stay tuned for more updates and a truly evolved portfolio experience!

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
